TRAVIS_TEST
	Disables parts of the code that require calls to the OpenCL API
COLLECT_LOGS
	If set it will pass the lines to the engine to enable sending debug logs
FORCEINLINE
	Forceinlines the methods in the physics engine
	The difference should be minimal
DEBUG
	Used for debugging the internal parts of the engine
TRACE_TIME_ONLY
	If set it will trace only the delta time and will not call garbage collector methods
	If LEAK_TRACE is not set this flag has no effect.
LEAK_TRACE
	Collects frame data and garbage collector statistics when set
PROFILE
	Adds a few new properties to the physics engine that enables measuring the performance
ALLOWUNSAFE
	Makes certain regions in the physics engine compile as unsave code
CONSERVE
	If set the physics engine will conserve the momentum
